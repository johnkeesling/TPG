I just got a cellphone call from the SF Bay area. Did Doug Wilson just make a trade with the #StLBlues or something? #SJSharks #Sarcasm #NHL

Dougie likes to hit the restaurants. I like that! Showing his soft side like the massage parlor #sjsharks
Check out feature on #SJSharks 2010 5th rnd pick Freddie Hamilton, who is riding an 18 gm P streak (14G 15A) in OHL. http://bit.ly/dTZW1W (expand)
#sjsharks VS #redwings OH MY!
So I have a blank teal replica jersey and I want to get it lettered. What's the best place in the Bay Area to get that done? #sjsharks
The #SJSharks visit Detroit tonight in a battle of two of the hottest teams in hockey. http://bit.ly/emn79f (expand)
@FRW_ I'd like to see him back tonight vs the #SJSharks too. Oh well. Miss that Finn out there.
@7layerburrito yay for #SJSharks game at 7:30pm EST tonight! Tune it to the Sharks game and hide the remote from your bf.
AND there's a #SJSharks game on tonight at a reasonable time!! :D But so is the #NJDevils game.. so bf & I will be fightin over the HD TV ;)
Just had a flashback to last Playoff series vs the Wings, me and my friend eating Hot Wings in celebration of beating the Wings! #SJSharks
@TheDodgerhater Those were epic, but I'm hoping the #SJSharks only make another minor deal cause I don't want to see Seto or Pavs traded
@EpicPuckBunny is Sutter of the #Flames the same guy that used to coach the #SJSharks or is it his brother?
