#SJSharks squander another third period lead, fall 3-2 in the shootout http://sbn.to/fCt1Kt\n
Bummed about the #sjsharks game, but my kitten is lounging with me and I couldn\'t be any happier. #Itsthelittlethings\n
#SjSharks RT--->> #ChasinTheCool #Performin This #Sunday #SanJose Ca @ Johnny V\'s Show Starts At 8\n
#WaiveWallin it should be a no-brainer. #sjsharks\n
Happy with the point #sjsharks fans! Better than nothing! 9/10 isn\'t bad!\n
@BASportsGuy U dont have 2 be a hockey expert to no that the #sjsharks not scoring or winning in a shootout is creepy its there specialty\n
@BASportsGuy Kings goalie is a shutout master combined w/ the #sjsharks lack of new shootout move ideas. They blew it. Deserved the loss.\n
Clowe, Pavs, and Cooter. Y\'all gotta change it up. Backhand upstairs, wrister up top, deke/backhand 5-hole. They don't work anymore. #SJSharks\n
busting up laughing that my best friend is pimping me out to the #SJSharks!\n
YaySJS Always have faith!\n 
#sjsharks lose??I can not believe what i had just saw......why.....why....why?????I feel soo sad now!I felt like we will never lose again\n
The post is a goaltender\'s best friend! #NHL #LAKings #SJSharks\n
i still love my #sjsharks.\n
I'm no hockey expert, but the #SJSharks not scoring once in a shootout certainly looked strange and kinda sad.\n</string>
